            "step_description" : "To sift, either use a sifter or a fine mesh strainer also works. Coconut oil does not work very well in place of the vegan butter; it makes them very oily so I don't recommend it. You could sub applesauce for the vegan butter if you are oil free. If you don't want the brownies as sweet, it is perfectly okay to reduce the sugar, even to 1 cup. They will still turn out well, just not as sweet. When you initially take the brownies out of the oven, they will appear underdone and soft, but give them time to cool. They are even better the next day; fudgy and rich. These are NOT cake-like brownies. You may also use dutch processed cocoa powder for slightly different results. They will be a little less fudgy, and darker in color.To make this recipe gluten-free, use GF rolled oats and sub a gluten free flour blend for the whole-wheat pastry flour. If you donâ€™t have almond meal on hand, just replace it with more whole-wheat pastry flour."
