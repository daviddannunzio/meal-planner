Return to a boil, reduce the heat to the lowest setting, cover with a fitted lid, and simmer, stirring every 5 minutes or so to prevent the grits from sticking to the bottom, add more water if necessary, until smooth like cream of wheat, 28 to 30 minutes. Stir in butter and cheeses, remove the pan from the heat, and keep warm."
