Add the rinsed rice and coninue boiling, reducing the heat as necessary to prevent overflow, until the rice is pleasantly tender but still offers a light resistance to the bite, 40 to 55 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat, drain the rice, and return it to the pot. Cover and let the rice rest for 10 minutes, then uncover and stir in the salt. Set aside."

When you're ready to serve, drizzle the mixture with just enough dressing to lightly coat the salad (you might have a little extra) and toss to combine.

This salad is best the day it's prepared, but it keeps well chilled, for 2 to 3 days."
