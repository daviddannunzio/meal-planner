Stack the slabs on top of each other and slice through them lengthwise to make 3 even columns, then slice across to make 5 even rows."

Fold the towel(s) over the cubed tofu, then place something heavy on top (like another cutting board, topped with a cast iron pan or large cans of tomatoes) to help the tofu drain.
