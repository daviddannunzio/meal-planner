Slice the stem and the cap lengthwise into large pieces. Prepare the onion, garlic and celery. Heat oil in a large sauce pan on medium heat. Add onion, garlic and celery and fry until fragrant, then add the chanterelle mushrooms and sear for a couple of minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the lentils and broth or water, bring to a boil, then lower the heat and let simmer for 20 minutes or until the lentils and chanterelle are tender, but still with a chewy texture. Seasoning to taste. Serve in bowls and garnish with freshly grated pecorino cheese and finely chopped parsley."
