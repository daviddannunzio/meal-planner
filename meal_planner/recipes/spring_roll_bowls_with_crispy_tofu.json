Then cube it and cover it with the rest of the dish towel or more layers of paper towels.  Press with a heavy object(cast iron skillet, cookbooks, cutting board) for 30-40 minutes to remove as much moisture as possible. This results in perfectly crispy tofu."

Then add in the arrowroot or cornstarch and salt and toss again until all of the tofu is coated and there are no powdery spots left.
