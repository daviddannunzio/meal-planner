Add the rice and cook, stirring, until toasted, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the vinegar. Ladle about 1/2 cup of the warm stock into the rice and stir continuously until absorbed, about 2 minutes. Continue adding the stock in ladlefuls, stirring until the rice has absorbed all the liquid, before adding the next ladleful of stock. (You may not need to add all the stock.) When the rice is tender and the risotto has a creamy texture, remove the pan from the heat and stir in the lemon zest, lemon juice, cream, and Parmesan. Season with salt. Serve."
