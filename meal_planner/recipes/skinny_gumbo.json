Add the parsley and cook 1 more minute. Push the vegetables to the edges of the skillet, add the chicken, and season with 1 teaspoon of the salt and black pepper to taste. Cook until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Sprinkle the flour over the chicken and vegetables. Add 3 cups water, the sausage, tomato, okra, bay leaf, the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and black pepper to taste. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the chicken is tender and cooked through, 30 to 35 minutes."
