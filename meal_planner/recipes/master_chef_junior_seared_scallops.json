(Alternatively, char under a broiler.) Transfer to a plastic bag, close the bag, and let the peppers steam for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the peppers from the bag, peel off the skins, and discard the stems and seeds. Place the peeled peppers in a blender or food processor. Add the onion, garlic, cilantro, vinegar, coriander, olive oil, and lemon juice. Blend until smooth. Transfer to a medium bowl and season with salt."
