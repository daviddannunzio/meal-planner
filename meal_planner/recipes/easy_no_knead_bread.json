This dutch oven bread is best when made with all-purpose flour. Sea salt: I recommend pure, fine sea salt for the best outcome! Yeast: Active dry yeast is the best choice for this no knead bread recipe, however you can use rapid rise yeast but you will still need to let it rise overnight. Water: Make sure to use warm water (105 degrees). It should feel warm to the touch but not hot. Optional mix-ins. If you'd like to create fun varieties, try mixing in parmesan cheese, fresh herbs, roasted garlic, etc."
