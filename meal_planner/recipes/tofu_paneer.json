Add onion, ginger, garlic and chilies, and sauté until deeply golden and fragrant, stirring often, about 15 minutes, taking your time here.  Add the spices ( coriander, cumin, garam masala and mustard seeds) and sauté 2-3 more minutes.  Add the frozen spinach and cup of water, lower heat and simmer uncovered until the spinach is just thawed."

If mixture is too dry to blend, add just enough water to get the motor going.  Taste, and adjust heat by adding a little cayenne if you want more of a kick. This will seem slightly salty at first but once you add the paneer, it will soak up the salt."
