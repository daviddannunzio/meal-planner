Add the soy sauce mixture and stir again to coat. Cook for a minute or two, then add the cauliflower. Stir and cover. Cook for about 3 minutes. Uncover, dial the heat up even more, and cook until the cauliflower and tempeh (chicken) starts to brown a bit. If you need to add a bit more water to the pan, carefully do so, 1 tablespoon at a time. Remove from heat and stir in the black pepper. Taste, add more pepper if you like, and serve immediately."
